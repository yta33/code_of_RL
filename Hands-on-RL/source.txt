Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there lived a king who had three daughters.
The king was wise and just, beloved by all his subjects. However, he was worried about the future of his kingdom.
He wanted to ensure that his daughters would rule wisely and justly after him.
To test their wisdom, he devised a plan that involved a series of challenges.
The eldest daughter was clever and resourceful, always finding solutions to difficult problems.
The middle daughter was kind-hearted and empathetic, beloved by the people.
The youngest daughter was brave and adventurous, never afraid to face danger.
Each of them approached the challenges in their own unique way, and the king watched them with great interest.
